# Photo Processing: Crop and Black-and-White Filter
This project provides tools for image processing, including cropping photos and applying a black-and-white filter. It offers two main features:

Photo Cropping: Allows you to crop an image and select the desired area.
Black-and-White Filter: Applies a black-and-white effect to any image.

After uploading the image, the user can select an area to crop. The selected part of the image will be saved and ready for further processing.

Once the image is cropped, the user can apply the black-and-white filter, transforming the image into grayscale with customizable settings.
